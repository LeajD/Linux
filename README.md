 Project how to build a custom, minimal Linux distribution using a bespoke Linux kernel paired with BusyBox for a lightweight user space.

# Distro-custom
 Project demonstrates a hands-on approach to building a lightweight Linux environment from scratch by combining custom kernel builds, minimal user-space tools (BusyBox and the custom shell), and low-level system call integration.

# firewalld
 Describes how Linux handles networking from physical interfaces (e.g., eth0, wlan0) to protocols (TCP/IP, ICMP) and routing. It also covers how firewalls secure the system using tools like iptables or firewalld.

# Hardening

# Luks
 Describes how disk encryption on Linux using Luks works.

# LVM
 The document also contrasts traditional partitions with LVMâ€™s flexibility, highlighting benefits like dynamic resizing, multi-disk aggregation, efficient backups via snapshots, and overall easier disk management.

# RAID
 How to set up a native LVM-based RAID 1 configuration on Linux and compares RAID mirroring to snapshots.

# SELinux-ACL
 Explains how SELinux enhances security on Linux systems by enforcing policies that go beyond traditional permission models and how administrators can use various SELinux tools to monitor, diagnose, and customize security policies.
